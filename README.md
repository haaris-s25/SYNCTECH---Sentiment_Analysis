# SYNCTECH---Sentiment_Analysis

---

## Overview
This project utilizes Google Colab, a powerful cloud-based platform for AI and ML projects, to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The goal is to analyze public opinion trends by classifying reviews as positive or negative based on their sentiment.

## Features
- **Google Colab Integration:** Utilizes Google Colab for its robust Python environment and easy access to GPU resources.
- **Dataset Management:** Integrates with Google Drive for storing and retrieving datasets, ensuring seamless data handling.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier:** Trains a Naive Bayes model on the training dataset to classify sentiments.
- **Export Results:** Outputs sentiment analysis results to Google Sheets for easy visualization and sharing.

**Open in Google Colab:** Open the project in Google Colab for execution.
- Upload the notebook file (`sentiment_analysis.ipynb`) to your Google Drive.
- Open it using Google Colab to execute the code cells.

**Run the Notebook:** Execute the notebook (`sentiment_analysis.ipynb`) step-by-step to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

## Usage
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and transform the dataset to prepare it for sentiment analysis.
- **Model Training:** Train the Naive Bayes classifier using the training dataset.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Apply the trained model to classify sentiments in the test dataset.
- **Export Results:** Export sentiment analysis results to Google Sheets for further analysis and visualization.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 72.77% on the sentiment classification task, providing insights into the sentiment distribution of the analyzed Twitter dataset.
